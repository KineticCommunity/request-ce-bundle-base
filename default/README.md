## Overview
This bundle is used internally by Kinetic Request CE and is a good starting point to build out your own bundles.

It includes the default:

* Listing of Kapps (kapp.jsp)
* Form display (form.jsp)
* Login page (login.jsp)
* Reset Password (resetPassword.jsp)


## Customizing


When you customize this bundle it is a good idea to fork it on your own git server to track your customizations and merge in any code changes we make to the default.

We also suggest you update this README with your own change summary for future bundle developers.

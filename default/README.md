## Overview
This bundle is used internally by Kinetic Request CE and is a good starting point to build out your own bundles.

It includes the default:

* Listing of Kapps (kapp.jsp)
* Form display (form.jsp)
* Login page (login.jsp)
* Reset Password (resetPassword.jsp)


## Customizing
This bundle easily allows for minor personalization by including attributes on your KAPP (Kapp Console -> Setup Tab -> Attributes).  These include:

* _logo-url_ : By including this attribute we will use this logo instead of the home icon on the top-left of the page
* _logo-height-px_ : By including this attribute we will set the height of the logo in the header. Default is 30px with 10px of padding.

When you customize this bundle it is a good idea to fork it on your own git server to track your customizations and merge in any code changes we make to the default.

We also suggest you update this README with your own change summary for future bundle developers.
